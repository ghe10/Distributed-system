# Distributed-system
This is another implementation of the disributed system class project. ZooKeeper is used in the new implementation. For now the file system is separated into two parts: the cluster membership part and the storage part. Append operation will be allowed in this system.
Note : this implementation doesn't statisfy the requirement of cs425, so don't do anything strange!
